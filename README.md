# ny-taxi-pipeline
The NY Taxi Data Pipeline is an end-to-end data engineering project designed to demonstrate a production-grade ETL/ELT architecture using modern open-source tools — Apache Airflow, dbt, and Postgres.
It processes real-world New York City Taxi Trip Records, automating data ingestion, validation, transformation, and analytics-ready output following a structured Raw → Core → Analytics (Medallion-style) architecture.
